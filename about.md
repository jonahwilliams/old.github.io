My name is Jonah Williams.  I am a freelance data scientist, full-stack developer,
and startup enthusiast developing data-driven apps. While I've enjoyed the freelance and graduate work,
my life is changing and I am looking for more stable employment. I am seeking new challenges, new technologies
to learn about, new deadlines to meet, but bookended with more consistent paychecks!
I like to work hard and play hard, and I am looking for a company that does the same.
